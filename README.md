# Tom's Tools
Just a bunch of useful tools that I wanted to have available to me when developing, browsing, and whatever while coding.

Currently, all commands are sent to your clipboard ready to be pasted elsewhere.  The Command History box is just for reference and can also be copied from if you want something from the past.

⚠️ Nothing is encrypted or hidden, don't screen share while using this.
